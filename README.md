####MVP features: 
Current functionality includes searching for breweries by the user inputting a city which returns a list of all breweries for that city. Users can click on a "details" button for each brewery which pops up general information about the brewery, including a hyperlink to the website and a google map iframe rendering its location. 
####

####Post MVP features:
Creating local storage in app so users can save selected breweries to create a brewery crawl.
Improved UI for mobile devices, especially with formatting of text in the modal.
Troubleshoot Google Maps API issue of certain brewery locations not rendering in the iframe. For these cases,
Google Maps iframe with multiple markers for the entire list of brewery results for each city search.
Creating a methodology for the order of search results, such as distance from an inputted location or based on user's current location
